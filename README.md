## 🏀 Introduction

This side project is built for sports fans to subscribe their favorite teams, and get real-time match information on all sports.

Currently this project is still on the fly, therefore, the score shown may not be corrent on the day. However, as I'm really excited to build this project, soon the APIs will be connected, and all the dummy data will be removed in all pages.

Try the app: https://livescore-2f15c0310cf4.herokuapp.com/main

## Features (🚧 means there are still things to add, feature not completed)

A simple version of a livescore web application, the features can be categorized into 6 main chunks:

- User can view all matches on the date selected (currently the dummy data only shows 14th of July and 18th of July if you'd like to try out the gist of the application)
- User can subscribe a team from main page, when the bell turns solid, it means you've successfully subscribed the team. And when you click the top right side of the page "Favorites", you will see only the teams that you subscribed on the date 🚧
- User can access the detail of the match by clicking the right section "Featured Match", and view the details of the match 🚧
- User can access differnt leagues, by clicking one of the country in the All Leagues section, and select a league of your choice
- User can view a certain team from by clicking the team logo in the matchinfo page 🚧
